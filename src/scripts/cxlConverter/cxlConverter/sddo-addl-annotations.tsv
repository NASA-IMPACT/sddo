obo:SDDO_3000110		"The meaning of a column within a spreadsheet (e.g., identifier or height); the meaning of each pixel in an image (e.g., surface temperature)|another test example"			"A data parameter is any characteristic that can help in understanding data content. That is, a parameter is a data element that is useful, or critical, when identifying  or describing the content of a data object."												
obo:SDDO_3000095						"While agreed that metadata is just data about data and so is really an unneeded term, we recognize that the term metadata is often applied to information about data no matter its form.  In many cases, a metadata product is available for access, even if the data is not.  Thus a Metadata Product Service is any information product or service that returns metadata about science data."

obo:SDDO_3000048						"It is generally agreed that data is in the eye of the beholder; but, for the purposes of this project the terms data and data product are limited to traditional mostly numeric science data products that NASA holds and actually calls data, data sets or data products. Thus a DataProductService is any product or service that returns bulk science data."

This would mean the ontology would need to include the concepts of a presidential directive and a strategic plan - wait for a use case before implementing this change."			SDDO team
