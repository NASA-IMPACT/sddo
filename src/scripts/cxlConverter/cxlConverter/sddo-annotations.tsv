obo:SDDO_0000001	assay					An assay is an investigative (analytic) procedure for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence, amount, or functional activity of a target entity.												
obo:SDDO_0000002	event					Something observable that happened at a given time and place				Adapted from http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/NCIT_C25499								
obo:SDDO_0000005	data parameter		The meaning of a column within a spreadsheet (e.g., identifier or height); the meaning of each pixel in an image (e.g., surface temperature)|another test example			A data parameter is any characteristic that can help in understanding data content. That is, a parameter is a data element that is useful, or critical, when identifying  or describing the content of a data object.												
obo:SDDO_0000007	metadata product						While agreed that metadata is just data about data and so is really an unneeded term, we recognize that the term metadata is often applied to information about data no matter its form.  In many cases, a metadata product is available for access, even if the data is not.  Thus a Metadata Product Service is any information product or service that returns metadata about science data.											
obo:SDDO_0000012	platform		A spacecraft, a person, a ship, a piece of laboratory equipment			A platform is a physical object to which an instrument is attached or in which it is contained.

obo:SDDO_0000020	instrument		A camera, MODIS, a survey instrument (e.g., google form)			An instrument is a physical object that can be used to collect data.				Adapted from pds:Instrument								
obo:SDDO_0000025	person																	
obo:SDDO_0000027	experiment					A plan for a coordinated set of actions and observations designed to generate data, with the ultimate goal of discovery or hypothesis testing.

obo:SDDO_0000072	data product or service						It is generally agreed that data is in the eye of the beholder; but, for the purposes of this project the terms data and data product are limited to traditional mostly numeric science data products that NASA holds and actually calls data, data sets or data products. Thus a DataProductService is any product or service that returns bulk science data.

obo:SDDO_0000134	NASA mission					A NASA mission is a mission led or funded by NASA	"Per the NASA SMD glossary at https://science.nasa.gov/glossary/ a mission is a ""NASA Science-funded activity with the purpose of meeting goals laid out by presidential directive, and detailed in Science Mission Directorate's strategic plan.""  This would mean the ontology would need to include the concepts of a presidential directive and a strategic plan - wait for a use case before implementing this change."			SDDO team
